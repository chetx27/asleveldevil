# Asleveldevil

A minimal web-based platformer inspired by deceptive game design and troll mechanics.  
The game intentionally breaks player expectations by changing rules mid-level and punishing assumptions.

## Overview

This project is a simple 2D platformer built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
While the visuals and controls are minimal, the gameplay is intentionally unfair and unpredictable, inspired by games that rely on surprise rather than difficulty.

The goal is simple: reach the exit.  
The challenge is learning which rules are real.

## Features

- Basic 2D platformer mechanics
- Fake platforms that disappear
- An exit that betrays the player on first contact
- Intentionally misleading level design
- No external libraries or frameworks

## Controls

- Left Arrow: Move left  
- Right Arrow: Move right  
- Up Arrow: Jump  

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
